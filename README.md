# b2p: Bracken to Phyloseq

`b2p`is an R package that converts Bracken output into phyloseq objects for microbial diversity analysis.

## Installation

To install `b2p` from GitHub:

```R
install.packages("devtools") # or remotes
devtools::install_github("braddmg/b2p/package")
```
## Setting Up the Database
Run the following command to download the database required to assign full taxonomy paths to the phyloseq object. This process may take several hours depending on your internet connection. The database size is approximately 87 GB.
```R
library(b2p)
setupdb(path = "your/path")
```
## Converting bracken output file

Refer to the example in the Example folder for the correct Bracken file format. The package works with outputs generated by running Bracken.
"Note: The metadata file must have the same sample names as those in the Bracken file, but without the ".bracken_num" extension."

```R
physeq <- b2p(file = "bracken.tsv", database = "path/to/database.sql")
```
